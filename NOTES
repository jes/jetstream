Remember to check whether randomers can delete our streams by pretending to be an admin!

videoroom api:
  create
  destroy
  edit
  exists
  list
  allowed
  kick
  listparticipants - use this to know how many viewers there are
  join
  joinandconfigure
  configure
  publish
  unpublish
  start
  pause
  switch
  leave

just one html page; if there's a uri-fragment, decode it and start up as a viewer, otherwise start up as a streamer

publisher:
 - create(permanent=false, secret=randomstring, is_private=true)
   we get the room id back in the "room" field
   set the room secret so that randomers can't edit the room
 - join(ptype=publisher, room=myroom)
   no display name required
 - publish(audio=true, video=true, ???)
   copy this from videoroomtest

viewer:
 - join(ptype=subscriber, room=myroom, feed=???, audio=true, video=true)
   feed needs to be "unique id of the publisher to subscribe to", should come from uri fragment
