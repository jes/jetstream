 - experiment with simulcast, decide whether it's an improvement
 - add ui for selecting bitrate
 - nicer title/logo
 - bit of explanatory text
 - better feedback/recovery about errors:
    - tell the publisher when they're getting "slowlink" warnings - automatically drop bit rate?
    - tell the subscriber when the publisher has left
    - if the publisher has to refresh the page, bring them back to the same room?
 - tell the subscribers and publisher how many viewers there are
 - let the publisher pause and resume video and audio streaming
 - installation instructions
 - deploy on jetstream.club, with ssl certificate
 - can "lag" stack up over time or does it self-correct?
 - why does the player window sometimes resize itself? should we just bang it to the full browser size?
 - give the publisher an accurate view of their own stream at the current bit rate
