Required for "launch":
 - make the page look less amateurish
 - better feedback/recovery about errors:
    - tell the subscriber when the publisher has left
 - installation instructions
 - deploy on jetstream.club, with ssl certificate
 - can "lag" stack up over time or does it self-correct?
 - let subscribers mute the audio, and maybe change volume if convenient
 - see if we need to set any of the password settings in Janus in order to avoid trouble
 - not too unpleasant on mobile, for both publisher and subscriber

Nice to have:
 - better feedback/recovery about errors:
    - if the publisher has to refresh the page, bring them back to the same room?
    - test restarting the server and make sure the publisher and subscribers automatically recover the stream
 - tell the subscribers and publisher how many viewers there are
 - let the publisher pause and resume video and audio streaming
 - why does the player window sometimes resize itself? should we just bang it to the full browser size?
 - give the publisher an accurate view of their own stream at the current bit rate
 - how long should "slow link" appear for?
 - let both publishers and subscribers record the stream to a file
 - shorter room ids, and alphanumeric (what if we just base58 encode the binary of the current id? would be about 1/2 as long, so not much better)
